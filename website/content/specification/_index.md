# Metaschema Specification

The Metaschema Information Modeling Framework provides a standardized, format-agnostic information modeling approach supporting schema, code, and documentation generation *all in one*.

This specification defines the core concepts, syntax and semantics of the Metaschema Information Modeling Framework.

The specification is divided into the following sections.

- [**Overview:**](overview/) Provides a high-level description of the framework's design goals and overall approach to defining an [information model](/specification/glossary/#information-model).
- [**Information Modeling:**](information-modeling/) Describes the information modeling approach used in the framework, with a focus on the core graph and object-oriented concepts supported by the framework.
- [**Syntax**:](syntax/) Documents the model used to describe a [Metaschema module](/specification/glossary/#metaschema-module).
- [**Data Types:**](datatypes/) Lists the built-in data types provided by the framework.
- [**Glossary**:](glossary/) Provides definitions for commonly used technical terms used in this documentation.
