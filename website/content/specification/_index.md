A *Metaschema* defines an *information model*, which is a set of *information structures* for a given *domain*, in a format-neutral form. Each information structure expressed in a Metaschema is a *managed object* composed of semanticly well-defined data structures. Documentation about the meaning (semantics) and use of a given structure (abstract syntax) is annotated within a given managed object.

A metaschema can be used to generate a schema for a corresponding *data model*, which is a representation of an *information model* in a format specific serializable form (e.g., XML, JSON, YAML). These generated schema can be used to validate that data is conformant to the asscoiated format, and thus conformant to the information model defined by the Metaschema.

A Metaschema can be used to automatically generate converters capable of converting content that is schema conformant to one Metaschema generated format to another format generated by the same Metaschema. This is possible because the Metaschema allows data in one format to be mapped to the defined information model, and from the information model to the other format. In this way the Metaschema provides a *supermodel* that unifies each related format.

Additionally, a Metaschema can be used to automatically generate format specific model documentation that is aligned with the concepts used in a given format.

Finally, a Metaschema can be used to automatically generate language-specific data structures or classes, and serializers/deserializers that are capable of writing and reading data that is conformant in a given Metaschema derived format using the language-specific data structures. This generative approach allows application developers to focus right away on business logic and user interface features instead of building the basic common data structures needed for all applications that work with information from a given domain.

These Metaschema capabilities, which can be applied to any information domain, serve the needs of developers who need to support multiple data formats for a given domain, or that need to choose a specific technology stack that is well-suited to their application. In either case, use of the generative capabilities of the Metaschema allow content to be easily converted to a given format, and for modeling efforts to be multipled across a number of formats without incuring additional overhead for the additional formats.

We hope and expect that developers' experience with different approaches will inform further efforts to unify and consolidate a coherent Metaschema-based information modeling framework.

This specification provides a basis for the development of interoperable toolchains supporting the generative capabilities of the Metaschema framework, and as a reference for information modelers producing Metaschema-based information models.
