This project has been split from the [Open Security Controls Assessment Language](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL) project from which it originated. As a result, we are still using some of the OSCAL contact information.

Please email the [OSCAL team](mailto:oscal@nist.gov) with any questions you have about this project or if you are interested in getting involved.

Please visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/metaschema) for more information, schemas, and examples.
