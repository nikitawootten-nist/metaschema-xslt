A [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/usnistgov-OSCAL/metaschema) is available for Metaschema discussions. This is a great place to discuss issues with the NIST developers and ask for assistance with building Metaschema-enabled tools. This room is also setup with GitHub integration, which provides a good summary of recent Metaschema GitHub repo activities within the chat room.
